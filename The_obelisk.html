                            <p style="text-align: center;">The Obelisk</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">The angular mass that jutted from the root of creation arched upward and pierced into the sky. There</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">was no sound and there was no movement. Time slipped by slowly as if halted by a force pushing</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">against it. Argaven stood, transfixed upon the blue obelisk. A wave of unknown emotion swelled within</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">him and tears rolled down his face. He had never seen anything such as this mass before. A holy wonder</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">that belonged to him and him alone.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">Argaven studied the blue surface of the mass and found that it was smooth. And in that smoothness, he</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">could see the reflection of the elements that made physical, the world around him. Time had shape, and</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">that shape was made of an endlessly complex weave of silver strings spun around an elegant crystal. The</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">very air around him was a strange color. It was a dull grey, as if inked by a spill of black. There was sound</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">that existed only within the blue reflection. The sound was an endless drone of harmonic overtones that</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">were crisp and sweet. But in that sweetness, could be heard the end of the world. A shattering of earth</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">and a collision of stars. The sudden creation of the universe and It’s silence all together. There was</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">tragedy in its design but there was a mark of beauty as well. Argaven stared into the crystal surface of</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">the obelisk. And within its complex, holy, terrible intent, he surmised he was peering into the very</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">depths of oblivion.Try as he might, Argaven could not look away from the mystic reflection within the holy artifact. There</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">was death and creation and the distant cries of beings, eons long gone. He could not close his eyes. In</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">time they dried and withered away but his sight did not falter. He could see the shape of time stretch,</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">contract, and fold. And within the creases he could read humanity’s fate as if it were a map. And though</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">they were his eyes and they were good, he then saw beyond the crisp horizon of mortality and accepted</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">this gift of doom. Argaven felt his skin harden and corrode away as the years slipped through the fine</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">cracks of space and pressure of gravity. A god is not born from sweetness and warmth. A god is born</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">from the crushing weight of the universe falling upon a single man</p>
