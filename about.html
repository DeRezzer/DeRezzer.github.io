<p align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Though you may know me by another name, I hope that when you read anything here, you dissociate it with who you have come to know. I am of course that person but within this little slice of the internet, it's fun to be someone else. It's not anything so dramatic and I'm not meaning for it to be. It's really all in artistic taste with only a level or two of deeper meaning. Ask me about it sometime, I won't mind explaining.</p>
<p align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">

</p>
<p align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I've been writing for some time (years, I guess) but I never thought that I would ever have the desire for others to read what I had written. Several instructors have encouraged me to do so in the past and I guess I finally caved. So, through this simple website that I put together, I hope to share my work as I grow as a writer. I have confidence in my ability but no one ever stops getting better.</p>
<p align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
  <br>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Most of my work that I plan to post here will be poetry but if the mood strikes me, I'll share a short story every now and then as well.</p>
<p align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
  <br>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I hope that you enjoy reading what I have written and come back of your own accord now and then, to see if anything new has been posted.</p>
