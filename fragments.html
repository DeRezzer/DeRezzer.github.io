When you fall to pieces many times over, it is nearly impossible to find them all. Live with what you have, even if there is slightly less than what you used to be. A fleeting thought here and a fleeting thought there, far away on a mountain top and below an ancient sea.</p>

Remember their faces and keep their voices in your heart. Build them up as tall as mountains or pristine and beautiful like marble fountains.</p>

In the small cafe you frequent, in the crooked house across your street, in old churches holy and unholy. They are on old cassette tapes. You have to rewind them first but they exist within the small enclosure. They have no form but shapeless they are not. Press the play button and let them sing.&nbsp;</p>

Help them remember the taste of sweetness. Wet their lips with a cloth damped with water and pray they feel what you feel. Kiss them upon their brow and lay upon them the ancient seal that distinguishes them from man or beast.&nbsp;</p>

There were moments when he would stare and others in which he showed he cared. There are always foul intentions no matter how their tongues sound.

You’ll wake with a start, a lump in your throat, and tears in your eyes. And within a fluid thought you’ll realize [REDACTED] won’t be coming back. [REDACTED] would tell you their inner thoughts and you wrote them on your skin. You would recite them when you slept, like holy scripture.&nbsp;</p>

Beautiful thoughts are cast away and slowly swallowed by the day and left to dry in the night sky. Eventually consumed and never immortalized.</p>

You cannot bare to be in the same space as her. Her dark skin draws you in and her lithe body ensnares you. If you were to draw too near, you would be swallowed whole and devoured by her eyes. She is the black hole within the center of your universe and you are a derelict constellation spinning itself into madness, tearing itself apart. Surely, you burn alone? What fear lives in the heart of this hunger? Desiring her affections is easy but admission to this desire is a tortuous pain. You have grown to know yourself too well and know that there is nothing that you can do stop these emotions from crawling out of whatever dark tomb they were buried in long ago. It is something that you wish you could so easily cast away from yourself. But to cast it away would only cause you to remain with a crystal emptiness that is both shapeless and without sound. You would be opaque and smeared across the stars, never knowing what smooth sweetness awaited beyond this gate that you so fear.&nbsp;</p>

Nevertheless, you remember how sweet the taste was. It was something so real and present that you never gave a thought to what it would feel to be without it. You’re far way from that now, but you wish you were still near. In the morning there is only silence and within that silence there is an ache that is like a white mountain. Looming in the distance with all it’s melancholy grace, holding it’s thick blanket of snow close to it’s delicate body. One day it snaps, and the avalanche shows no mercy.</p>

You always see them across your street, or in the garden next to your house. You always know where they are. The Others hide and keep their eyes on you. Watching every little move you make. They know where you keep your secrets. They know who you love the most. They know why you drove home a little faster on April 9<sup>th</sup>, 20[xx] and kept your eyes on the door. They know.</p>

They first start with the empty words on playgrounds when you were a child. The jokes and laughs that used to mean the whole world to you. They seem to sift away with the gentle breeze and disappear into the light blue abyss above that never seems to swallow you, no matter how long you stare into it.&nbsp;</p>

You can easily form the sweet words that melt off your lips when they meet hers. They drip and drip and drip. And where they fall, small blue flowers bloom, leaving marks of love for the Goddesses to look down and see proof of life and emotional existence within this frame of time. Form the words slowly. Feel how soft they are in your mouth but don’t be afraid to cut yourself or bite your tongue. Sometimes, blood must be spilled. Creation and it’s intimate process is seldom clean, why should writing be any different?</p>

They’ll learn not to blame you but mostly, you’ll learn to love your own company.</p>

You stare for too long and you are never sure if the the things on the other side are truly reflections. Did that door move? Was that a shadow along the wall? You forget which eye color your mother gave to you.</p>

They told you what they hope to be and have shown you glimpses of that beautiful potential. They yearn to tower overhead and loom far in the distance. They yearn for the quiet. The silence only tall peaks can bring. But you have left them in a place without hope. They will only know the small corner of the muggy room in which you burn your morning toast. They slowly dry and whither away, as they echo somewhere in the fragments you unknowingly left behind.</p>
